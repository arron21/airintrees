There is a corporation called the Irvine Company.

It was established in 1864 by its original founders James Irvine I, Benjamin and Thomas Flint, and Llewellyn Bixby.

It also created what is known as a "planned city" the city of Irvine.

I have personally spent a good amount of time growing up in southern Orange County, and Irvine.

The thing that is really interesting to me about Irvine is that it is owned by the Irvine Company, meaning that the entire city is considered private property.

Irvine is know to be one of the safest cities in the entire United States of America, it has be on the top 10 list for as long as I can remember... It is very apparent too.

Through the winding streets that seem to always end in some cul-de-sac or some shopping mall, in between the meticulously cut grass and trimmed pine trees, or near some 10/10 school, the feeling of Irvine is always there; and the feeling is fabricated.

Every part of Irvine seems to be impeccable, and that comes with a price tag, and that price is set by the Irvine Company.

Real estate prices in Irvine have been rising since the 1970s when they removed all the cattle farms, and established housing. A house that was built in 1972 with less than a 1/5 of an acre of land might sell as much as 2.5 million dollars today.

While that might seem high, its very average for Irvine. You might be able to find a property available below 1 million, but that property will probably have some HOA fees associated with it, most Irvine properties do.

What about future real estate development?

The Irvine Company has been building what I call Mega Apartment Complexes. These are apartments that go on for multiple city blocks, with thousands of units, and the Irvine Company controls the prices. This means that they can charge around $2k for a sub 700sq foot apartment. They can justify this cost by saying that it is x% of what a mortgage would cost in the same area. This is extremely convenient for the Irvine Company since they have the ability to artificially raise the prices of both single family homes and apartments. It is a win-win for the Irvine Company, and a lose-lose for any young adult trying to get a start on life.

Living in Irvine will trap you in a cycle of renting forever. This doesn't just happen in Irvine, but almost any city that is within the land that the Irvine Company owns, which stretches to almost every surrounding city within the Orange County area.

The children born in these cities will never be able to afford to purchase a house in their home town.

It makes me question, what makes a city great? Is it the trees? the shopping? the real estate values? the schools?

The people that were part of the Irvine experiment will eventually be driven out of the very city that they helped build... or rather payed the HOA fees to build.

The city does not belong to the people of Irvine, but to the Irvine Company.

It's legacy will be great schools, safe neighborhoods, and absolutely nothing significant otherwise.
