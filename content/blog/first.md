Hello World!

New Year, New Me.

I am updating my website to a HUGO SSG.

I plan to use this as a blog for my day to day work experiences as well as other things I find cool.

I am really liking the idea of these Static Site Generators. They are wicked fast and super cheap to run. I am happy with the simplicity of them. I am also using a service called forestry.io to help with the CMS side of things. All in all I am pretty excited to see what is possible with JAM stack and static sites in general.
