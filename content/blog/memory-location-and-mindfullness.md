Have you ever experienced the phenomena of forgetting something right as you enter a new room? For example lets say you are eating something in the kitchen and you remembered you need to check your email, and so you go to the living room to get on the computer to check your email

When you arrive to the living room you suddenly think "what am I doing here"?

Was it the act of going to a new location that caused your sudden lack of memory?

Is your brain deciding you did not need that information anymore?
