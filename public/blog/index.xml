      <description>I went to the dentist yesterday. I had not been to the dentist in a couple years so I figured I was overdue for a cleaning.
Turns out I was only getting x-rays on this initial visit and I have to go back for a cleaning next week. I have 1 cavity on the side of one of my teeth; I had not noticed it before.
They also want me to consult an oral surgeon because they think my wisdom teeth are going to become an issue in the future.</description>

      <description>Hugo is pretty cool, but I have been having some difficulties trying to convert a &amp;lsquo;blog-less&amp;rsquo; theme into a theme that includes a blog.
I am still new to HUGO so what should be a simple task such as creating a list of blog posts and viewing said blog posts has had its hurdles. I have discovered a few &amp;lsquo;oh duh&amp;rsquo; things about getting a blog to work, I am sure there will be more &amp;lsquo;oh duh&amp;rsquo; moments in the future.</description>

      <description>Hello World!
New Year, New Me.
I am updating my website to a HUGO SSG.
I plan to use this as a blog for my day to day work experiences as well as other things I find cool.
I am really liking the idea of these Static Site Generators. They are wicked fast and super cheap to run. I am happy with the simplicity of them. I am also using a service called forestry.</description>
